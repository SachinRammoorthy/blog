          Work can – and should – be fun.
          Don't regard "spare time" as the prize and the time you spend working as the pain you endure to earn it.
          Avoid "prestigious" work –  if it didn't suck, they wouldn't have had to make it prestigious.
          Give yourself time to figure shit out.

        The most impressive people I know are all terrible procrastinators. So could it be that procrastination isn't always bad?<br><br>

        Most people who write about procrastination write about how to cure it. But this is, strictly speaking, impossible. There are an infinite number of things you could be doing. No matter what you work on, you're not working on everything else. So the question is not how to avoid procrastination, but how to procrastinate well.<br><br>

        Put off working on small stuff to work on big stuff.<br><br>

        Real work needs two things errands don’t: big chunks of time, and the right mood.<br><br>

        If you get inspired by some project, it can be a net win to blow off everything you were supposed to do for the next few days to work on it.<br><br>

        The cost of an interruption is not just the time it takes, but that it breaks the time on either side in half. You probably only have to interrupt someone a couple times a day before they're unable to work on hard problems at all.<br><br>

        Startups are most productive at the very beginning, when they’re just a couple guys in an apartment. The main reason may be that there’s no one to interrupt them yet. It may be better to be overworked than interrupted.<br><br>

        Errands are so effective at killing great projects that a lot of people use them for that purpose. Someone who has decided to write a novel, for example, will suddenly find that the house needs cleaning. People who fail to write novels don't do it by sitting in front of a blank page for days without writing anything. They do it by feeding the cat, going out to buy something they need for their apartment, meeting a friend for coffee, checking email. "I don't have time to work," they say. And they don't; they've made sure of that.<br><br>

        Don’t let errands eat up the day, to avoid facing some hard problem.<br><br>

        The most dangerous form of procrastination is unacknowledged type-B procrastination, because it doesn't feel like procrastination. You're "getting things done." Just the wrong things.<br><br>

        What's the best thing you could be working on, and why aren't you?<br><br>

        Most people will shy away from this question. I shy away from it myself; I see it there on the page and quickly move on to the next sentence. Hamming used to go around actually asking people this, and it didn't make him popular. But it's a question anyone ambitious should face.<br><br>

        The trouble is, you may end up hooking a very big fish with this bait. To do good work, you need to do more than find good projects. Once you've found them, you have to get yourself to work on them, and that can be hard. The bigger the problem, the harder it is to get yourself to work on it.<br><br>

        Another reason people don't work on big projects is, ironically, fear of wasting time. What if they fail? Then all the time they spent on it will be wasted. (In fact it probably won't be, because work on hard projects almost always leads somewhere.)<br><br>

        If you want to work on big things, you seem to have to trick yourself into doing it. You have to work on small things that could grow into big things, or work on successively larger things, or split the moral load with collaborators. It's not a sign of weakness to depend on such tricks. The very best work has been done this way.<br><br>

        I think the way to "solve" the problem of procrastination is to let delight pull you instead of making a to-do list push you. Work on an ambitious project you really enjoy, and sail as close to the wind as you can, and you'll leave the right things undone.<br><br>
