        To do something well, you have to like it.<br><br>

        Tediousness is not the defining quality of work.<br><br>

        Work can literally be fun – fun like playing.<br><br>

        People pretend to enoy their work because you’re supposed to. Why? Because “to do something well, you have to like it.”<br><br>

        A parent who set an example of loving their work might help their kids more than an expensive house.<br><br>

        If you think something’s supposed to hurt, you’re less likely to notice if you’re doing it wrong.<br><br>

        How much are you supposed to like what you do?
        <ul>
          <li>Do what you love doesn’t mean, do you what you would like to do most this second.</li>
          <li>Upper bound: The rule about doing what you love assumes a certain length of time. It doesn't mean, do what will make you happiest this second, but what will make you happiest over some longer period, like a week or a month.</li>
          <li>Lower bound: You have to like what you do enough that the concept of "spare time" seems mistaken. Which is not to say you have to spend all your time working. You can only work so much before you get tired and start to screw up. Then you want to do something else—even something mindless. But you don't regard this time as the prize and the time you spend working as the pain you endure to earn it.</li>
        </ul>

        To be happy I think you have to be doing something you not only enjoy, but admire. You have to be able to say, at the end, wow, that's pretty cool.<br><br>

        Merely reading books doesn't quite feel like work. You have to do something with what you've read to feel productive.<br><br>

        Try to do things that would make your friends say wow. <br><br>

        What you should not do, I think, is worry about the opinion of anyone beyond your friends. You shouldn't worry about prestige. Prestige is the opinion of the rest of the world. When you can ask the opinions of people whose judgement you respect, what does it add to consider the opinions of people you don't even know?<br><br>

        Prestige is like a powerful magnet that warps even your beliefs about what you enjoy. It causes you to work not on what you like, but what you'd like to like.<br><br>

        Liking the idea of being a novelist is not enough; you have to like the actual work of novel-writing if you're going to be good at it.<br><br>

        Prestige is especially dangerous to the ambitious. If you want to make ambitious people waste their time on errands, the way to do it is to bait the hook with prestige. That's the recipe for getting people to give talks, write forewords, serve on committees, be department heads, and so on. It might be a good rule simply to avoid any prestigious task. If it didn't suck, they wouldn't have had to make it prestigious.<br><br>

        If you admire two kinds of work equally, but one is more prestigious, you should probably choose the other.<br><br>

        The test of whether people love what they do is whether they'd do it even if they weren't paid for it — even if they had to work at another job to make a living. How many corporate lawyers would do their current work if they had to do it for free, in their spare time, and take day jobs as waiters to support themselves?<br><br>

        Math would happen without math departments, but it is the existence of English majors, and therefore jobs teaching them, that calls into being all those thousands of dreary papers about gender and identity in the novels of Conrad. No one does that kind of thing for fun.<br><br>

        It's hard to find work you love; it must be, if so few do. So don't underestimate this task. And don't feel bad if you haven't succeeded yet. In fact, if you admit to yourself that you're discontented, you're a step ahead of most people, who are still in denial.<br><br>

        Although doing great work takes less discipline than people think—because the way to do great work is to find something you like so much that you don't have to force yourself to do it—finding work you love does usually require discipline.<br><br>

        "Always produce" is also a heuristic for finding the work you love. If you subject yourself to that constraint, it will automatically push you away from things you think you're supposed to work on, toward things you actually like. "Always produce" will discover your life's work the way water, with the aid of gravity, finds the hole in your roof.<br><br>

        Don't decide too soon. Kids who know early what they want to do seem impressive, as if they got the answer to some math question before the other kids. They have an answer, certainly, but odds are it's wrong.<br><br>

        Don’t let your life get chosen for you by a high school kid (give yourself time).<br><br>

        Early on, seek jobs that let you do many different things, so you can learn faster what various kinds of work are like.<br><br>

        Whichever route you take, expect a struggle. Finding work you love is very difficult. Most people fail. Even if you succeed, it's rare to be free to work on what you want till your thirties or forties. But if you have the destination in sight you'll be more likely to arrive at it. If you know you can love work, you're in the home stretch, and if you know what work you love, you're practically there.<br><br>
