          Don't try to think up startup ideas.
          Notice problems – ideally, problems that <i>you</i> face, and would pay to have solved immediately.
          Give yourself time, and work on projects – anything that seems cool.
          Don't worry about competition, this is really a good sign.
          Live in the future, and build what seems interesting.

        The way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas. It's to look for problems, preferably problems you have yourself.<br><br>

        The very best startup ideas tend to have three things in common: they're something the founders themselves want, that they themselves can build, and that few others realize are worth doing. Microsoft, Apple, Yahoo, Google, and Facebook all began this way.<br><br>

        By far the most common mistake startups make is to solve problems no one has.<br><br>

        Why do so many founders build things no one wants? Because they begin by trying to think of startup ideas. That m.o. is doubly dangerous: it doesn't merely yield few good ideas; it yields bad ideas that sound plausible enough to fool you into working on them.<br><br>

        The danger of an idea like this is that when you run it by your friends, they don't say "I would never use this". They say "Yeah, maybe I could see using something like that." Even when the startup launches, it will sound plausible to a lot of people. They don't want to use it themselves, at least not right now, but they could imagine other people wanting it. Sum that reaction across the entire population, and you have zero users.<br><br>

        When a startup launches, there have to be at least some users who really need what they're making — not just people who could see themselves using it one day, but who want it urgently. Usually this is a small group.<br><br>

        You can either build something a large number of people want a small amount, or something a small number of people want a large amount. Choose the latter. Not all ideas of that type are good startup ideas, but nearly all good startup ideas are of that type.<br><br>

        When you have an idea for a startup, ask yourself: who wants this right now? Who wants this so much that they'll use it even when it's a crappy version one made by a two-person startup they've never heard of? If you can't answer that, the idea is probably bad.<br><br>

        There’s usually a path out of an initial niche. But this isn’t necessarily easy to find.<br><br>

        Neither Apple nor Yahoo nor Google nor Facebook were even supposed to be companies at first. They grew out of things their founders built because there seemed a gap in the world.<br><br>

        The verb you want to be using with respect to startup ideas is not "think up" but "notice.” And how do you do that? By getting to the leading edge of a field.<br><br>

        Once you're living in the future in some respect, the way to notice startup ideas is to look for things that seem to be missing. If you're really at the leading edge of a rapidly changing field, there will be things that are obviously missing. What won't be obvious is that they're startup ideas. So if you want to find startup ideas, don't merely turn on the filter "What's missing?" Also turn off every other filter, particularly "Could this be a big company?" There's plenty of time to apply that test later. But if you're thinking about that initially, it may not only filter out lots of good ideas, but also cause you to focus on bad ones.<br><br>

        Give yourself some time. You have a lot of control over the rate at which you turn yours into a prepared mind, but you have less control over the stimuli that spark ideas when they hit it. If Bill Gates and Paul Allen had constrained themselves to come up with a startup idea in one month, what if they'd chosen a month before the Altair appeared?<br><br>

        A good way to trick yourself into noticing ideas is to work on projects that seem like they'd be cool. If you do that, you'll naturally tend to build things that are missing. It wouldn't seem as interesting to build something that already existed.<br><br>

        Live in the future and build what seems interesting.<br><br>

        But don't feel like you have to build things that will become startups. That's premature optimization. Just build things.<br><br>

        Worrying that you're late is one of the signs of a good idea. Even if you find someone else working on the same thing, you're probably not too late. It's exceptionally rare for startups to be killed by competitors — so rare that you can almost discount the possibility. So unless you discover a competitor with the sort of lock-in that would prevent users from choosing you, don't discard the idea.<br><br>

        The question of whether you're too late is subsumed by the question of whether anyone urgently needs what you plan to make.<br><br>

        Err on the side of doing things where you'll face competitors. Inexperienced founders usually give competitors more credit than they deserve. Whether you succeed depends far more on you than on your competitors. So better a good idea with competitors than a bad one without.<br><br>

        You don't need to worry about entering a "crowded market" so long as you have a thesis about what everyone else in it is overlooking. In fact that's a very promising starting point.<br><br>

        Any startup that succeeds is either going to be entering a market with existing competitors, but armed with some secret weapon that will get them all the users (like Google), or entering a market that looks small but which will turn out to be big (like Microsoft).<br><br>

        Turn off the Schlep Filter – don’t discard ideas that seem painful to do, eg: Stripe.<br><br>

        The place to start looking for ideas is things you need. There must be things you need.<br><br>
