          Work can – and should – be fun.
          Don't regard "spare time" as the prize and the time you spend working as the pain you endure to earn it.
          Avoid "prestigious" work –  if it didn't suck, they wouldn't have had to make it prestigious.
          Give yourself time to figure shit out.

        There is a strong correlation between being smart and being a nerd, and an even stronger inverse correlation between being a nerd and being popular. Being smart seems to make you unpopular.<br><br>

        Intelligence, itself, is obviously an enviable quality. All other things being equal, any person would prefer to be on the smart side of average rather than the dumb side.<br><br>

        So why are smart kids so consistently unpopular? They don’t really want to be popular. At least not as much as they would like to be smart – not simply to do well in school, though that counted for something, but to design beautiful rockets, or to write well, or to understand how to program computers. In general, to make great things.<br><br>

        I wonder if anyone in the world works harder at anything than American school kids work at popularity. Navy SEALs and neurosurgery residents seem slackers by comparison.<br><br>

        Nerds don’t realize that it takes work to be popular. They're like someone trying to play soccer while balancing a glass of water on his head. Other players who can focus their whole attention on the game beat them effortlessly, and wonder why they seem so incapable.<br><br>

        Unpopularity is a communicable disease; kids too nice to pick on nerds will still ostracize them in self-defense.<br><br>

        Why is the real world more hospitable to nerds? It’s very large, and the things you do have real effects. It’s no longer enough just to be pleasing. It starts to be important to get the right answers.<br><br>

        The other thing that's different about the real world is that it's much larger. Out in the real world, nerds collect in certain places and form their own societies where intelligence is the most important thing. Sometimes the current even starts to flow in the other direction: sometimes, particularly in university math and science departments, nerds deliberately exaggerate their awkwardness in order to seem smarter. John Nash so admired Norbert Wiener that he adopted his habit of touching the wall as he walked down a corridor.<br><br>

        Why do people move to suburbia? To have kids! So no wonder it seemed boring and sterile. The whole place was a giant nursery, an artificial town created explicitly for the purpose of breeding children.<br><br>

        The stated purpose of schools is to educate the kids. But there is no external pressure to do this well. And so most schools do such a bad job of teaching that the kids don't really take it seriously – not even the smart kids. Much of the time we were all, students and teachers both, just going through the motions.<br><br>

        In almost any group of people you'll find hierarchy. When groups of adults form in the real world, it's generally for some common purpose, and the leaders end up being those who are best at it. The problem with most schools is, they have no purpose. But hierarchy there must be. And so the kids make one out of nothing.<br><br>

        When there is some real external test of skill, it isn't painful to be at the bottom of the hierarchy. A rookie on a football team doesn't resent the skill of the veteran; he hopes to be like him one day and is happy to have the chance to learn from him. The veteran may in turn feel a sense of noblesse oblige. And most importantly, their status depends on how well they do against opponents, not on whether they can push the other down.<br><br>

        Nerds are just playing a different game, and a game much closer to the one played in the real world. Adults know this. It's hard to find successful adults now who don't claim to have been nerds in high school.<br><br>
